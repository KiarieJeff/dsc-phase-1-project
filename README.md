#### Overview

In this project will use exploratory data analysis in order to determine what kinds of movies are currently performing the best at the box office and to provide suggestions for what kinds of movies to produce.

### Business Understanding

Our job is to investigate box office successes as we work to establish a prosperous film company. We will get insightful information that will help the head of Microsoft's new movie studio choose the kinds of movies to produce by thoroughly analyzing the existing landscape of film industry successes. These conclusions will act as benchmarks to direct the studio toward fruitful endeavors

Our main goal is to investigate and evaluate the kinds of movies that are now dominating the box office. To do this, we must examine trends, patterns, and contributors to commercial success across a range of genres.

The ability of the research's insights to be transformed into decisions that can be implemented will be one of the success factors. These data should enable the CEO of Microsoft's movie studio to make well-informed decisions about the kinds of movies to develop, the partnerships to pursue, and the marketing tactics to use.
